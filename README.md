<!-- [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9846024d-ea59-46cc-9a63-2ae9bef96816/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/penciil/deploys) -->

## About

Penciil is a straightforward ASCII art sketchpad that generates ASCII art animations from your drawings.

You can use it online or install it from [penciil.domi.land](https://penciil.domi.land/).

## Usage

To draw or erase on the canvas use the mouse (on a computer) or your finger (on a mobile device). When you are done press the play button to generate the animation.

## Development

The app is built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

The following `npm` scripts are available:

- `start`: runs the app for development, reloading on file changes
- `build`: builds the app and outputs it in the `public/build` directory
- `serve`: serves the `public` directory for localhost requests
- `validate`: provides diagnostics checks for unused css, a11y hints and js/ts compiler errors
